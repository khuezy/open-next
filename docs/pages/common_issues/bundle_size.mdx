#### Reducing Bundle Size

Next will incorrectly trace dev dependencies to be included in the output `node_modules`, which will significantly increase the lambda bundle. For example, the @swc/core-\* binary is ~33MB!

Add this to your next.config.js to help minimize the lambda bundle size:

```typescript
    outputFileTracingExcludes: {
      '*': [
        '@swc/core',
        'esbuild',
        'uglify-js',
        'watchpack',
        'webassemblyjs',
        'sharp'
      ],
    },
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  NextJS currently doesn't expose `outputFileTracingExcludes` as an environmental variable so `open-next`cannot programmatically set this like it does for`output`and`outputFileTracingRoot`.
  Currently, next uses `webpack` to trace server actions, so you shouldn't add `webpack` to the excludes list, otherwise it will break server actions.
</Callout>

#### Unzipped size must be smaller than 262144000 bytes

To identify the module that's taking up too much space (and isn't serverless friendly):

```bash
du -hs .open-next/server-function/node_modules/* | sort -rh
```

If your app requires the offending library, then consider moving your business logic of the `api` to its own lambda, eg: `/api/v2` => `Api Lambda`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  There is a [PR](https://github.com/sst/open-next/pull/242) to remove some dev dependency from the output node_modules but that requires more testing before it can merge.
</Callout>

#### Common issues

##### Sharp

`sharp` is not needed outside of the `Image Optimization` function so you should not have it as a dependency. But if you are depending on `sharp`, be sure to install it with the correct flags for your lambda.
eg: `--arch=arm64 --platform=linux --target=18 --libc=glibc`

##### pdfjs

If you need to use pdfjs, you should install it with `npm i pdfjs-dist--no-optional` because the optional dep: `canvas` takes about 180MB.
